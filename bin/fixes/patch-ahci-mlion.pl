# Patch IOAHCIBlockStorage to delay its start by 200ms.  This delay avoids
# a timing bug which can otherwise cause the AHCI identify command to fail.
# This bug manifests itself as a "Still waiting for root device" error at boot
# time under OSX 10.8, and 10.8.x, when booting from SATA disks.
# This timing bug (race condition?) is seen on some systems with intel 6 series
# chipsets (sandy bridge h67, z68, p67), as well as some mobile sandy bridge
# chipsets.
# Affected systems include gigabyte desktop motherboards with non-uefi bios,
# mobile systems with uefi bios (at least some securecore tiano based systems)
# such as the vostro 3450.
#
# This patch works on OSX 10.8 releases starting with developer preview 4
#
# Version 0.4

#1. patch relocation table for our patch point - kprintf() -> IOSleep()
#2. Make unconditional call to IOSleep(delay) at beginning of kext
